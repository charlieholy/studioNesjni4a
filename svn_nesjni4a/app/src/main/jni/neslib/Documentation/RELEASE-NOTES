----June 29, 2001:
 -Added the source code for zlib.  The makefile in the zlib directory should
  be included by the platform makefile(such as Makefile.win) or zlib should
  be linked in some other way.  If you use the zlib that comes with this
  source distribution, you'll need to set up your compiler to recognize
  the zlib subdirectory as a global include directory(like "-Izlib" with gcc).
 -Changed the expected behavior of FCEUD_BlitScreen().  Added two new functions,
  FCEUI_SetFirstRenderedLine() and FCEUI_SetLastRenderedLine().  See
  porting.txt for details.


----May 25, 2001:
 -A few deobfuscations of the code(more will come in the future).
 -Defined some macros to declare functions using different(faster) calling
  conventions.  After redeclaring memory map emulation functions,
  there was a somewhat significant speed increase.  Using the new calling conventions
  for PPU_hook and MapIRQHook type functions resulted in a more significant
  speed increase.
 -Some of the driver<->emulator interface code has changed.  Much more
  will change in the future.
 -Added some stuff in types.h to (possibly) help people with compiling
  FCE Ultra with MSVC++.

----May 5, 2001:
 -Optimized RAM reading/writing emulation in fce.c a little.
 -Moved the UNIF board emulation code to the "boards" subdir.  UNIF support
  isn't even near being done, though.  Not a high priority either.

----April 16, 2001:
 -Much of the driver interface code was restructured/rewritten, especially the
  input-related code.  
 -All driver functions called by the emulator are now prefixed with "FCEUD_".
  (I may do something similar with the names of the driver interface functions).
 -The core emulation code has been updated slightly since the Windows .53
  release, but the changes are so minor that another binary release is not
  necessary.

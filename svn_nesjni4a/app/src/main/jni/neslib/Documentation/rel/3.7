	The Game Genie ROM image is loaded from the file "gg.rom" in the
	base directory the first time Game Genie emulation is enabled and
	a ROM image is loaded since the time FCE Ultra has run.

	The ROM image may either be the 24592 byte iNES-format image, or
	the 4352 raw ROM image.

	Remember that enabling/disabling Game Genie emulation will not take
	effect until a new game is loaded(this statement shouldn't concern
	any of the "run once" command-line driven ports).

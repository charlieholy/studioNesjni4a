	You will need the FDS BIOS ROM image in the base FCE Ultra directory.
	It must be named "disksys.rom".  I will not give this file to you, so
	don't ask.

	Two types of FDS disk images are supported:  disk images with the 
	FWNES-style header, and disk images with no header.

	You should make backups of all of your FDS games you use with FCE 
	Ultra.  This is because FCE Ultra will write the disk image back to 
	the storage medium, and the disk image in RAM might have been corrupted
        because of inaccurate emulation(this case is not likely to occur, but 
	it could occur).

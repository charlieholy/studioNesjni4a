        In TCP/IP network play, the server will be player one, and the
        client will be player 2.

        Zapper emulation and power pad emulation currently do not work with
        network play.

        Having Game Genie or PAL emulation enabled on only one side
        will cause problems.

        Both players MUST use the same ROM/disk image and SRAM
        file(if applicable).

	When using FDS or VS Unisystem games with network play, only player
	1 will be able to insert disk, eject disk, insert coins, toggle dip
	switches, etc.

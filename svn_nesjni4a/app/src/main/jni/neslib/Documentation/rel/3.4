/*  3.4)        Light Gun Notes                                               */
/******************************************************************************/

	Currently, the NES Zapper and the light gun used with the VS
	Unisystem(I will call both the same name, Zapper) are supported.
	Most(all?) NES games expect the Zapper to be plugged into port 2.
	and most(all?) VS Unisystem games expect the Zapper to be plugged 
	into port(?) 1.

	The LEFT mouse button is the emulated trigger button for the
	Zapper.  The RIGHT mouse button is also emulated as the trigger,
	but as long as you have the RIGHT mouse button held down, no color
	detection will take place, which is effectively like pulling the
	trigger while the Zapper is pointed away from the television screen.
	Note that you must hold the RIGHT button down for a short
	time(greater than just a fast click, shorter than a second).
	
	Zapper emulation currently does NOT work with network play, so
	don't even try it. I may add support in the future if enough
	people want it or if I want it.

        FCE Ultra currently only supports VS Unisystem ROM images in the
        iNES format. 

        ROM Images:

         * VS Unisystem games that are about 49,000 bytes in size most likely
           use mapper 99.
         * Other VS Unisystem games will use other mappers.  Here is a short
           list of games and the mappers they use:

               CastleVania - 2
               Dr. Mario   - 1
               Goonies     - 151
               Gradius     - 151
	       Ice Climber - 99
               Platoon     - 68

        Palette(s):

         * The colors in many VS Unisystem games may be incorrect.  This
           is due to each game having its own PPU, and thus using a
           different palette than games that use a different PPU.

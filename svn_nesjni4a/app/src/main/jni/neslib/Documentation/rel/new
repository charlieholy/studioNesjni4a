	*  Screen snapshots can now be taken while playing an NSF.
	*  Saving screen snapshots will no longer corrupt the frame buffer.
	*  Added many more games to the list of games that usually are found
	   with bad iNES headers.
	*  Fixed more network play bugs.  It should now work correctly(how
	   many times have I said or implied that...).
	*  The NSF player will now disable the FDS sound channel on song
	   initialization(fixes a problem with the Zelda no Densetsu
	   rip).
	*  Reads from $4090 and $4092 while emulating the FDS will now return
	   the current envelope settings.  Affects "Ai Senshi Nicole" 
	   and "Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa", at least.
	*  Merged a lot of pirate MMC3 multicart emulation code with the main
	   MMC3 emulation code.
	*  Added support for the MMC5's split-screen mode.  This fixes the
	   introduction in "Uchuu Keibitai SDF".
	*  Writes to $8000-$FFFF with D7 set during MMC1 emulation will
	   cause the MMC1 mode register to be OR'd with $C.  This fixes
	   "Robocop 3".
	*  Replaced an MMC1 hack that I used to get "Bill and Ted's Excellent
	   Video Game Adventure" to work with something more accurate.
	*  Fixed the MMC5 read handler to return the data last on the data
	   bus instead of $FF when a read occured to an unmapped address.
	   This fixes the lockup problem in "Bandit Kings of Ancient China"
	   and possibly other games.
	*  Added support for the game "Ishin no Arashi" in the iNES format
	   (I added an entry with its CRC32 value and the number of 8KB
           WRAM banks it needs into the MMC5 WRAM size table).
	*  Added support for MMC1 games in the iNES format with 16KB of RAM
           via CRC32 comparisons(currently only Genghis Khan(USA), Romance
	   of the 3 Kingdoms(USA), and Nobunaga's Ambition(USA and Japan) are 
           recognized).
	*  iNES mapper 1 now supports pageable CHR RAM if CHR ROM is not
	   present.  Fixes "Family School".
	*  Added support for iNES mappers 51 and 52.  Thanks to Kevin Horton
	   for the information.
	*  Modified MMC3(iNES mapper 4/118/119) IRQ counter emulation.  Fixes
	   problems in "MegaMan 3", "Gun Nac", and the Japanese version of
	   "Klax", but it *might* cause problems with other games.
	*  Fixed an iNES mapper 32 emulation bug.  "Ai Sensei no Oshiete"
	   works now.
	*  Fixed iNES mapper 33/48 IRQ emulation.
	*  Fixed iNES mapper 16 IRQ emulation.
	*  Added support for "Famicom Jump 2" as iNES mapper 153.
           If a good(as far as I can tell) dump is loaded, FCE Ultra will
           automatically fix the mapper number.
	*  The VS Unisystem bit in iNES headers is no longer recognized.
	   Too many games have this bit set when it shouldn't be set.
	   Now VS Unisystem games are recognized by CRC32 value.
	*  Reads from $4015 no longer reset DMC IRQ.  This fixes the
	   title screen of "Romancia".
	*  PPU NMI now occurs a few cycles later.  Fixes the "BattleToads"
	   lockup problem.
	*  BRK emulation now sets the I flag.
	*  Changed a few zero-page address mode functions to read directly
	   from emulated RAM.

        FCE Ultra can load data from both PKZIP-format files and
        gzip-format files.  Only one type of (de)compression algorithm is
        supported:  "deflate"; this seems to be the most popular compression
        algorithm, though.

        A compressed FDS disk image will only be saved back to disk if it
        uses the gzip format.

        All files in a PKZIP format file will be scanned for the
        followings extensions:  .nes, .fds, .nsf, .unf, .nez, .unif
        The first compressed file to have one of these extensions will be
        loaded. If no compressed file has one of these extensions, the
        first compressed file will be loaded.

/*  3.5)        Palette Notes                                                 */
/******************************************************************************/

	Palettes files are expected to contain 64 8-bit RGB triplets(each in
	that order; red comes first in the triplet in the file, then green, 
	then blue).  Each 8-bit value represents brightness for that particular
	color.  0 is minimum, 255 is maximum.

	Palettes can be set on a per-game basis.  To do this, put a palette
	file in the "gameinfo" directory with the same base filename
	as the game you wish to associate with and the extension "pal".  
	Examples:

		File name:		Palette file name:
		 BigBad.nes		 BigBad.pal
		 BigBad.zip		 BigBad.pal
		 BigBad.Better.nes	 BigBad.Better.pal


        With so many ways to choose a palette, figuring out which one will
        be active may be difficult.  Here's a list of what palettes will
        be used, in order from highest priority to least priority(if a condition
        doesn't exist for a higher priority palette, the emulator will
        continue down its list of palettes).

        NSF Palette(for NSFs only)
         Palette loaded from the "gameinfo" directory.
          NTSC Color Emulation(only for NTSC NES games).
           VS Unisystem palette(if the game is a VS Unisystem game and a palette
           is available).
            Custom global palette.
             Default NES palette.
